# 'Keep The Fish Alive' custom theme for OhMyFish
My own take on the default [OhMyFish theme](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/blob/master/docs/Themes.md): it turns `⋊> ~` into `⋊≡°> ~`. Moreover, it turns into `⋊≡⁎> ~` after an error -mimicking a dead fish- and it adds standardised information on project directories (<i>i.e.</i> git, node.js and bun) and virtual environments (<i>i.e.</i> pyenv, conda env).

This theme was optimised for the [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) terminal emulator, with the 'Afterglow' color theme.

## Installation
Clone this repository, move it to `.local/share/omf/themes/`. Then activate it with:
```
omf theme keep_the_fish_alive
```
It assumes the [fish](https://fishshell.com) shell and the 'omf' package to be installed. Both can be installed via [homebrew](https://brew.sh).
